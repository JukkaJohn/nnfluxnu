# nnfluxnu

The NNfluxnu package is a code based on NNPDF to fit neutrino PDFs using neutrino scattering events at the LHC. Using so-called closure tests, one can parametrise a neutrino flux using a feed-forward NN to make a theory agnostic parametrisation using pseudo data or event rate measurements from FASER/SND@LHC.
